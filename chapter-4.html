								<p><b><i>“What is Polaroid doing in South Africa?”</i></b></p>
								<p>This question is not one that Polaroid chemist Caroline Hunter expected to be asking herself on her way to meet her colleague, Ken Williams, for lunch one October afternoon in 1970. Passing through the photography department, a bulletin board caught their eye. On it, they recognized the face of someone they knew: another Black Polaroid worker. However, his name was now South African, and it was on an ID badge for the South African Department of the Mines. Hunter thought it looked like a mock-up for a Polaroid ID product, but what would Polaroid be doing in South Africa.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

									</div>
								<p>This question led Hunter and Williams to investigate and ultimately find that Polaroid was more involved in South Africa than was widely known. Poloroid, along with several other companies, sold film and cameras that were used to make the “passbooks” that controlled Black people’s movement under apartheid. Discovering Polaroid’s involvement in South Africa led Hunter and Williams to risk their jobs (and lose them) in founding the Polaroid Revolutionary Workers Movement (PRWM) (PRWM et al. 1971). They met with executives, took out ads in newspapers, and circulated leaflets around the Polaroid office building, including the above sketch, with the message: “Polaroid imprisons black people in sixty seconds. They sold this I.D. system to South Africa” (Schacter 2019).</p>
								<p>Although a specific camera is not named in this image, there was one device that the PRWM focused on in their activism: the ID-2, a full color instant film camera that could produce a printed image in about 60 seconds.</p>

											<div class="col-2"></div>
										</div>
									</div>
								<p>The pictures produced by the ID-2 were actually a composite of two images—one of the subject and one a copy of the surrounding ID, which were composited together, making a nearly unforgeable seal between them. And the ID-2 had one other special feature—a “boost” button for increasing the flash by 42%, which increased the range of dark tones that could be captured. Along with the camera’s portability, strong metal design, and quick photo development, the PRWM, scholars, and artists have speculated that ID-2 was not only intended for domestic (US) use but was also “Polaroid's answer to South Africa's very specific need” (Smith 2013). As another pamphlet from the PRWM so clearly states: </p>
								<blockquote>Identification is a basic tool in population control. Every totalitarian government has devised some means of subjugating its poeple [sic] through identity cards. In the past, these systems has [sic] been weak: they have been difficult to administer; cards could be tampered with and altered. Now Polaroid has put an end to all that. It has used its sophisticated technological know-how to create an almost foul-proof system of citizen identification. Known as the ID 2, Polaroid’s system takes your picture, develops it in two minutes, seals it in unbreakable plastic, and registers your name and other information in computers. Zap, you’re identified! Once you have the ID card, there is no way of destroying the record. Remember, the ID 2 takes two pictures. You get one. Who gets the other one? (PRWM and Africa Research Group 1971, 12)</blockquote>
								<p>We open this chapter with the Polaroid Workers Revolutionary Movement and the ID-2 because it demonstrates how oversight is a ubiquitous, powerful, and persistent rhetorical function of the visual that is distinct from the visual’s deliberative, forensic, and epideictic functions. Visual rhetoricians have sometimes recognized this oversight function, but typically only implicitly. To the extent that visual rhetoric scholarship has been influenced by Nicolas Mirzoeff’s The Right to Look (2011), we have taken up the presumption that hegemonic control is partly a matter of vision and have therefore tracked power through technologies of sight. And yet, even as rhetoricians cite Mirzoeff, for the most part we have continued to use the word “visuality” as a synonym for “pertaining to the visual,” rather than incorporating the word’s more structural and racialized meaning developed in The Right to Look. Etymologically, Mirzoeff explains, “visuality” begins as the capacity of a commander to envision the entirety of a battlefield and the role of the literal “Overseer” of slaves on a plantation. It is a term not merely for invoking what is seen but for recognizing the hegemonic work done by sight. Taking up that definition of “visuality” and extending it, this chapter suggests that oversight isn’t simply a metaphor for control but rather a defining rhetorical function of the visual. </p>
								<p>Moreover, in the spirit of Lisa Flores’ (2016) call for rhetoricians to recognize that all rhetorical criticism is racial rhetorical criticism, this chapter emphasizes that oversight, racialization, and colonization—though distinct—are impossible to disentangle from one another within Western (and particularly U.S.) visual contexts. Oversight, historically and in the present, is a profoundly racialized rhetorical function. Likewise, racialization has been and continues to be carried out through oversight—the rhetorical function of the visual most concerned with parameters, ordering, and control. Recent rhetorical scholarship—including books by Lisa Corrigan (2020), Ersula Ore (2019), and Dave Tell (2019)—make clear these links among race, violence, rhetoric, and oversight. As Simone Browne puts it, “The historical formation of surveillance is not outside of the historical formation of slavery” and its aftermaths (2015, 50). Thus, attention to oversight demands that scholarship in visual rhetoric take race—and particularly Blackness—seriously as a constitutive factor, whether initially obvious or not.</p>
								<p>Though oversight is a neglected rhetorical function in visual rhetoric scholarship, it has not been entirely absent, especially from rhetorical studies more broadly. Work addressing surveillance, biopower, and the quantified self, for example, all treat oversight as a rhetorical function.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p> Likewise, scholars across rhetorical studies have treated vision and race in tandem. Typically, the scholars who most deeply engage matters of oversight and race have been less explicitly engaged with visual rhetoric while visual rhetoric scholarship about race has paid attention to power and structures but rarely linked them to visuality as a rhetorical function.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p> Our purpose, then, is to connect those lineages in order to position oversight as ubiquitous and distinct enough to demand its own place in any overarching treatment of visual rhetoric.</p>

								<p>Etymologically, “surveillance” means “oversight.” It comes, as Browne explains, from “the French prefix <i>sur-</i> meaning ‘from above’ and the root word <i>-veillance</i> deriving from the French verb <i>veiller</i> and taken to mean observing or watching” (2015, 18). Of course, in the contemporary United States, surveillance is not always about the visible. It is, however, always about establishing control over the field of play. Surveillance may not, in other words, involve taking pictures, but it is nevertheless a practice of visuality. That practice of visuality, in its many forms, is what we term “oversight.” It includes these factors, all inseparable from race: concern for ordering and control; the creation and maintenance of power structures; and hegemonic organization of bodies and their positioning in space. Oversight names those rhetorical functions of the visual that enact social control through mediation of data, bodies, spaces, images, and affect. In the remainder of this chapter, we treat three scenes that illustrate oversight as a rhetorical function of the visual: the racial presumptions built into visual technologies, the history and present of policing, and the practices of refusal that inevitably accompany oversight. The Polaroid Revolutionary Workers Movement and the ID-2 accompany us along the way.</p>

									<p>Meet Shirley. She is the pale-skinned white woman on the right. And in the center. And on the left. While the women pictured in these photographs are (probably) not all actually named “Shirley,” this name was used to refer to these, and many other, models whose pictures were used for color balancing in film photography for decades: the eponymous “Shirley Cards.” As one photo lab professional put it, “She was the standard … If Shirley looked good, everything else was OK” (Barco 2014). But everything was only “OK” if you looked a lot like Shirley. By comparing developed prints to Shirley cards, technicians could adjust color print settings to match the ideal tones of the picture. Because Shirely was the model, however, some people (and products) looked better than others. The texture and depth of darker skin tones were obliterated in photographs ‘corrected’ based on Shirley Cards, and even if an individual technician had used a different model, portraits of Black and Brown skinned people often lacked nuance. Color film, and the processes by which it was developed, presumed whiteness by design (Roth 2009). Shirley’s whiteness (and thus the presumed whiteness of all photographic subjects) meant that anyone proactively wanting to capture darker tones—including skin tones—would need to supplement existing photographic technology with  a “boost” of light. The ID-2’s “boost button” offered one such feature to capture darker tones without designing new film and, in the process, reveals the link between white-washed visual technologies and the rhetorical function of oversight.</p>

									</div>
									<p>When viewing images of Shirley, visual rhetoricians might first think about representation: who gets to appear and participate in the polis. Through this lens of representation, we might notice how Shirley cards—like much other mainstream photojournalism, film, TV, and stock photography—frame the world on white terms. A more recent, and annual, example of this problem of visual representation is succinctly captured in the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite, which started in 2015 when every acting nomination was given to white actors—for the second year in a row.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> However, those paying closer attention likely also know that racial representation is only one of many ways that white supremacy is sustained through vision. Since at least 2013, when <i>Twelve Years a Slave</i> appeared, the white supremacist assumptions built into visual technology—which go well beyond the question of who appears on the screen or page—have been widely discussed in mainstream media, particularly with regard to cinematic and photographic.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>
									<p>For those who work with photographic technologies every day, the material effects of white supremacy have been an on-going subject of discussion and re-working. Hunter and Williams knew about the problem in the early 1970s. In 1977, Jean Luc Goddard refused to use Kodak film stock to shoot in Mozambique, declaring the material itself “racist” because it so completely failed to capture the shades and nuance of Black skin.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> Shifting attention from film to lighting—another crucial visual technology—contemporary filmmaker Ava Duvernay regularly addresses the importance of properly and artistically illuminating scenes with dark-skinned actors.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> And, as visual culture scholar Sarah Lewis (2019) explains, the nature and practice of visual technologies themselves have implications for how people are “recognized” in public.</p>
									<p>Lewis, in invoking the white supremacy built into common technologies, directs attention back to representation and participation—the familiar terms of democracy and deliberation. However, oversight, and the role that visual technologies play in visuality, is not merely a familiar rhetorical matter of who gets recognized to speak or participate in the public sphere. It is also, and more crucially, about the underlying rhetorical workings of state power and the terrains on which that power is differentially played out. Representation may well lay the groundwork for a more just society, but it is equally important to grasp the rhetorical theories and practices that pre-exist the possibility of representation and pervade the technologies through which that representation might happen.</p>

										</div>
									</div>
									<p>To think about the role visual technologies play in oversight, let’s return to the PRWM and the ID-2. As a chemist, Caroline Hunter knew why the ID-2’s “boost” button was such a standout feature. She worked on the instant film technology that gave the Polaroid company its breakthrough in the 1940s. Instant film contains a chemical packet at one end. When the image is captured, the camera’s rollers spread these chemicals evenly across the film, allowing the image to develop in minutes. Though this may sound like a simple, even familiar, process, photo development is as much art as science. Different chemical layers in the packets responded differently to varying light levels and were sensitive to different length light waves (i.e. what is processed in photography as contrast, saturation, and color). The chemicals chosen to successfully render a “normal”—i.e. white—subject were ill-equipped to register non-white faces. Without the boost button and the burst of additional light it provided, the instant film technology would not render darker tones with any or much detail. Although beliefs that “physics was physics” have been commonplace in the technological history of photo development, the images produced by this film–and the methods used to ensure they were consistent, such as Shirley cards,–reveal how visual technologies reflect the investments and norms of the societies that produce them and, therefore, participate in oversight by defining what can be seen, what must be made visible, and what can be obscured (Roth 2009; “Color Film”  2015).</p>
									<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-2"></div>
											<div class="col-8"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/ch-4/ID-button.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
											<div class="col-2"></div>
										</div>
									</div>
									<p>What has been generally referred to as a “boost” button on the ID-2, but is labeled as a “face brightener” on at least one version of this camera, drives home this argument–you only need to brighten faces if you assume that a significant portion of the faces to be captured on identification cards will be darker than an arbitrarily assigned white normal. Thus, even if Polaroid wasn’t designing the ID-2 specifically for South Africa, they did have in mind a multiracial society in which you would want to make visible and keep track of people with darker skin.</p>
									<p>This relationship between color films’ designed presumption of whiteness and the Polaroid ID2’s built-in, adjustable flash that better captured dark skin is particularly generative for understanding the multiple levels at which oversight functions—it both contributes to the everyday administration of normalcy and appears in the surplus of overt control. Visual technologies concerned with oversight simultaneously produce the unmarked and provide the tools necessary to mark the marked. Instant film technology, through its design presuming white skin, shaped who could be seen. Like many more recent digital technologies, such as webcams, AI, and facial recognition, visual technologies can quite literally invisibilize or refuse to see Black people (Benjamin 2019). However, as the ID-2 and its use in South Africa shows, the very same visual technologies that invisibilize also provide a powerful means of ordering and controlling. While such invisibilizing and the hypervisibilizing of the ID-2 may seem contradictory outcomes of the same technologies, they are actually both functions of oversight. Oversight, in this sense, functions through both the unacknowledged whiteness of the Shirley card and the boost button of the ID-2, through both the panopticon and the pillory.</p>

											<div class="col-2"></div>
										</div>
									</div>
									<p>Like the PRWM, we bring attention here to the technology itself because doing so draws attention to the rhetorical functions at work that exceed the more comforting frames of rhetorical democracy. It shows how oversight is more than a function of how technology is <i>used,</i> but is built into technological <i>design</i> at many levels as a means of organizing and ordering what is seen. This is especially important to recognize because technology companies, including Polaroid, often position themselves as neutral or even progressive, further obfuscating the role that technologies themselves play in oversight. As Ruha Benjamin warns, the fact “that new tools are encoded with old biases is surprising only if we equate technological innovation with social progress” (2019, 108). Thus, considering technologies themselves is critical work for understanding the rhetorical functions of the visual, especially concerning those tied to oversight. As we explore in the rest of this chapter, the technologies and rhetorical practices of oversight  extend far beyond photography, film, and other familiar visual technologies. </p>

									<h2>Policing</h2>
								</header>
								<section>
									<div class="image main"><img src="images/ch-4/4-almanac.jpg" alt="" /></div>
									<p>Oversight is the rhetorical function at work in all forms of policing. And, here again, it is impossible to separate oversight and race. Attending to oversight reminds us that race is also created, sustained, and given consequence through visual means. Soon after photography became an available means, slave holders began photographing the people they enslaved (Fox-Amato 2019). Louis Agassiz, in the 1850s, turned daguerreotypes to the task of scientific racism (Wallis 1995). Frederick Douglass was well aware of this fact and pushed back, using photography to refuse those racializing, surveilling processes while also explicitly recognizing that his presence—in photographs or in person—was always already racialized (Gates 2019).</p>
									<p>Just as the ID-2 camera, so useful for policing apartheid in South Africa, picqued interest among police forces in other places and was used in as many as 21 U.S. states for creating licenses, the history of policing as oversight in the United States is practically and ideologically grounded in anti-Blackness.“Blackness,” Bryan Wagner writes, “is an adjunct to racial slavery,” and both visuality and policing are too (2009, 1). Plantation oversight extended into public power and “slave codes” and “slave patrols” laid the institutional and ideological frameworks for subsequent policing. That history of anti-Blackness, as many have noted, continues to infuse policing as oversight, through control of movement, of bodies, and of racialized space.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></p>
									<p>Police visuality has extended state control over Black bodies in ways both explicitly and implicitly violent—not only slave patrols, lynching, Jim Crow laws, and police violence, but also anti-miscegenation laws, red-lining, school funding, and gerrymandering. Each of these forms of social control does its rhetorical work—shaping values, beliefs, and possibilities for action—through oversight. It identifies, maps, and tracks bodies—predicting and constraining where particular bodies will be seen. Even as political contexts and legal frameworks have shifted, oversight structures racialize public life today just as it did the plantation of the antebellum period.</p>

											<div class="col-3"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/ch-4/4-police-4.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
										</div>
									</div>
									<p>This inseparability of oversight from policing is particularly apparent when looking at different approaches to policing, all of which depend on oversight. Whether we’re looking at body cameras that track police activity from police perspective, “Broken Windows” policing that aggressively prosecutes low-level crime, “Community Policing” that emphasizes non-enforcement-oriented relationships, or militarized police departments using SWAT methods in residential neighborhoods, we’re dealing with oversight—again, the panopticon and the pillory. Depending on our ideological inclinations, we might describe some forms of oversight as better or worse, but each carries presumptions of control and hegemony. And, in most cases, how they function rhetorically—structuring arguments and shaping attitudes—is determined by the regimes of visuality involved. A shift from “broken windows” policing to “community policing,” for example, does not move away from oversight. Both forms privilege police power as a hegemonic right to look. They simply approach it differently.</p>
									<p>“Community Policing” focuses on officers building relationships and facilitating positive encounters. It gives officers and departments a sense of the community that includes school events and coffee klatches as well as crime. It gives community members a sense of the police that includes mentorship as well as enforcement and emergency response. It means that police officers and community members see each other, and not just in the pressure cooker of sirens and flashing lights. Evidence suggests that Community Policing results in improved relations between officers and communities.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> But, attending to oversight reminds us that community policing is still a practice of white supremacy at the level of the state. Part of why it “works” is that it gives police departments greater access to communities, and thus more extensive visuality. And yet, the community’s “right to look” is no more guaranteed in community policing than in “broken windows,” even if community policing opens new potential opportunities for public looking-back.</p>
									<p>Some responses to the PRWM efforts, both at the moment and in subsequent scholarship, emphasize that there is no evidence that Polaroid was working directly with the South African government. Indeed, Polaroid publicly announced that it would not do business with the apartheid regime. However, others point out that privately held businesses in South Africa doing business with Polaroid may well have been serving as intermediaries. And even if the ID-2 in South Africa was primarily used outside the official purview of the state, even if the ID-2 hadn’t ever been used to enforce apartheid as enacted by the South African government, its circulation in the South African market and its larger circulation as a tool for identification and control aligns it with that broader history of policing and visuality. In private or public hands, it captured and cataloged subjects, ensuring that they could be seen and their movements tracked. It is therefore ironic but not the slightest bit surprising, then, that when Caroline Hunter and Ken Williams arrived to work on a Monday after circulating PRWM flyers in the Polaroid building over the weekend, they were greeted by Polaroid security and Cambridge police. They had been identified as the source of the flyers because they had used their own employee ID cards to access the building over the weekend.</p>

									<h2>Refusal</h2>
								</header>
								<section>
									<div class="image main"><img src="images/ch-4/4-lasers-getty-hongkong.jpg" alt="" /></div>
									<p>Though we have treated oversight as a rhetorical function of the visual specifically calibrated to hegemonic practices and state power, its force is not absolute. Oversight also invites and is subject to counter-hegemonic practices. Such counter-hegemonic visual rhetorics have been well documented when they are organized, visible, public actions, like those outlined in chapter two as well as those taken by the PRWM. Protests, flyers, buttons, boycotts, and demonstrations are well known and widely studied visual means of resistance to state power. Indeed, the PRWM did make visible the sales of Polaroid products in South Africa, provoke the company to respond (at least on the surface, such as in advertisements), and raise $10,000 for South African liberation movements. However, treating oversight as a rhetorical function also directs our attention toward other means of resistance—including the refusal to be seen.</p>
									<p>Visual rhetoric has gotten closest to acknowledging the possibilities for resistance that are specific to oversightpossibilities that we refer to as “refusal”—by addressing visibility politics. Dan Brower’s work (1998) on self-stigmatization, for example, acknowledges the risks of being visible and the relative civic power required to wield visibility. And yet, such scholarship still, typically, engages the forensic frame. It is interested in those who make themselves visible and the risks they negotiate as part of their efforts to catalyze change. And the PRWM is still an excellent example of this. Hunter and Williams both made a lasting point and lost their jobs by making themselves visible through resistance. </p>
									<p>Alongside such catalytic, forensic modes of visual resistance, however lie tactics of refusal that have been less commonly accounted for in visual rhetoric scholarship. To illuminate those tactics, we need to move beyond the ID-2 as our primary case study. While it provides an ideal model of how oversight works, we can’t use its story to theorize broader practices of refusal, partially because the materials and rhetorical practices that have been recognized as resistance–and thus have typically been archived–are those concerned with the forensic. The PRWM may have indeed engaged in the types of refusal we turn to here, but precisely because these practices concern strategies of not being seen and avoiding oversight, they are also not generally visible in the archival materials that have been seen, saved, and cataloged.</p>
									<p>Therefore, we now turn to scholars such as Tina Campt, Saidiya Hartman, and Simone Browne who have specifically theorized refusal as a visual tactic that responds to oversight by undercutting, sidestepping, and evading it. For Campt, refusal is “a rejection of the status quo and the creation of possibility in the face of negation” (2019, 83). When faced with “a system that renders you fundamentally illegible and unintelligible,” a practice of refusal uses this “negation as a generative and creative source of disorderly power to embrace the possibility of living otherwise” (Campt 2019, 83). Campt and Hartman, through their Practicing Refusal Collective, have further theorized “black visuality” as a particular practice of refusal through the work of Black contemporary artists who enact “radical modalities of witnessing that refuse authoritative forms of visuality which function to refuse blackness itself” (Campt 2019, 80). </p>
									<p>These notions of refusal are not unknown to rhetorical scholars. Rubén Casas (2016) and Mira Shimabokuro (2015), for example, though they do not specifically invoke “refusal” highlight the rhetoricity of parallel practices in their studies of the rhetorical strategies engaged by undocumented immigrants and incarcerated Japanese-Americans, respectively. Casas and Shimabokuro each recognize tactics of omission, getting-by, and invisibility as productive rhetorics with individual and communal implications. We see the tactics they outline as practices of refusal that directly respond to state oversight. The skepticism of undocumented migrants offered tell-tale identification cards, for Casas, points to strategies of getting by that are not predicated on recognition by the state and, indeed, would be threatened by acquiescence to identification. Shimabukuro, likewise, in her reformulation of “writing to Gaman,” tracks rhetorical practices aimed at individual and community survival which cannot register as resistance to the state—or more traditional scholars—but that nevertheless refuse the conditions of incarceration. Even as the state and other power-brokers pursue an all encompassing visuality as their fundamental prerogative—the right to identify and incarcerate, these resistant rhetors refuse to be seen. Working in a different vein from activist publics that assert their own, counter-hegemonic, right to look, such tactics preserve public and private space by blocking vision and evading oversight. </p>
									<p>From rhetors living with dignity in desert concentration camps and immigrants refusing to accept state identification to protesters blocking security cameras and subverting facial recognition technologies—refusal is ubiquitous though often, by definition, unseen. Such tactics are neither micro-level forensic rhetorics nor passively a-rhetorical. Instead, they enact a completely different rhetorical function of the visual: the always inevitable counter-hegemonic response to oversight. Simone Browne defines this counter-hegemonic refusal as “undersight” or “dark sousveillance.” It is, she explains, “a way to situate the tactics employed to render one’s self out of sight, and strategies used in the flight to freedom from slavery as necessarily ones of undersight” (2015, 21). Refusal, then, turns our attention from the exceptional to the “quotidian,” the everyday practices and struggles of disrupting hegemonic gazes (Campt 2017, 59). </p>
									<p>As we worked on this chapter in 2019, one such tactic of refusal was used by protestors in Hong Kong, who not only hid their faces with masks, scarves, and helmets but also used laser pointers to confuse facial recognition technologies. These refusal tactics supported more traditional rhetorical practices by allowing protesters to continue to demonstrate, but they are also indicative of a larger body of refusal tactics that merit attention from visual rhetoricians. </p>

									<p>To further investigate refusal, rhetoricians might turn to the evolving (and escalating) project of evading facial recognition technology. Moving from camouflage-based practices like masks and CV Dazzle, or “Computer Vision Dazzle” to more advanced, algorithm-based strategies that make personal data unlearnable, the visual technologies of refusal are constantly evolving, responding to increasingly refined means of oversight. They have in common a commitment to remaining unseen by pervasive facial recognition technologies, refusing the hegemonic terms of engagement that have as CV Dazzle user Maud Acheampong notes, had fundamentally white supremacist purposes, writing “surveillance and tech has always disproportionately affected black folks.” Facial recognition technologies are pervasive, persistent, and ubiquitous, and their algorithms notoriously participate in the functions of oversight, not only in their use but in their design. Like the ID-2 and photo technology, facial recognition algorithms both create and administer normalcy while providing the conditions for control (Benjamin 2019; Noble 2018; O’Neill 2016). Digital refusals to be seen, in turn, join longstanding practices of fugitivity in evading and undermining the hegemonic normal. As Acheampong illustrates through use of CV Dazzle and Browne theorizes through the concepts of “dark sousveillance,” refusal is not merely a negative—a stepping out of sight—but also a means of world-making. Dark sousveillance “plots imaginaries that are oppositional and that are hopeful for another way of being” (2015, 21).</p>
									<p>Rhetoricians need to understand oversight as a rhetorical function of the visual because it allows us to recognize visual rhetoric as always thoroughly racialized, because it draws our attention to the non- and anti-democratic ways that hegemonic power wields the visual and visuality, and because it, ironically, makes powerful modes of resistance more recognizable in their full rhetorical complexity. Oversight, and its refusal, help us see the visual at work in contexts where the polis and the people are not the primary sources of power, where popular sovereignty is constrained or non-existent, and yet where people continue to act in defense of a better world for themselves and their neighbors.</p>
