									<h1>Sight Itself
									</h1>
									<p>Visual rhetoric has typically looked at things seen, not the act of seeing. But rhetoricians must follow the path of light and neural pulses through bodies if we are actually going to understand the rhetorical functions of the visual.</p>

									</div>
								<p>This picture is the opening screen of one of Harvard’s  “Project Implicit” Implicit Social Attitudes tests. This specific test was designed to capture participants’ underlying racial biases. You’ll be ‘taking’ the test in pictures as you work your way through this chapter. Under normal testing conditions, if you are like the vast majority of the U.S. population, and especially if you are white or Asian American, you would likely have an easier time associating faces that you perceive as white with positive words and faces you perceive as Black with negative words (Mason 2020). Whatever biases you have, you likely won’t notice their effect while looking at the pictures captured here, in this chapter. These illustrations don’t replicate the actual test conditions, after all. However, research suggests that neural pathways, developed over time and habituated in a white supremacist society, tend to replicate racism as data from photoreceptors in the eyes travel through the brain (Eberhardt et al 2003; Obasogie 2013; Friedman 2016).</p>
								<p>Sighted children as young as three months old visually register racial markers. What they see affects their friendship choices and beliefs about people well before they enter school (Sullivan et al 2020). Teaching evaluations, notoriously, are better at capturing students’ perceptions of their instructor’s race and gender than the instructor’s pedagogical performance (Bavishi et al 2010; Heffernan 2021). Both white college students and white police officers unconsciously look to and for Black faces when they have been primed to think about crime (Eberhardt et al 2004). These tendencies, typically termed “implicit bias,” are persistent and deeply seated, particularly among white people. They continue to appear even among white people who have worked to address their own racism, sexism, and other prejudices. Bias is embodied, and it is powerfully persistent.</p>

								<p>If you’re reading this project, you’re likely ready to accept that implicit bias has rhetorical bases and rhetorical functions. It may feel like more of a stretch to name implicit bias as pointing toward a rhetorical function of the <i>visual,</i> though. And, of course, implicit bias isn’t only a matter of vision.  Even so, tests for implicit bias, research on it, descriptions of it, and proposals for how to curb it invariably rely on sight as the primary trigger for implicit bias (though there has recently been new work on blindness and racial perception that complicates and contextualizes the presumption that race is a visual feature). Tests purporting to identify implicit bias, like the one that we’ve represented here, typically ask test subjects to associate pictures of people—phenotypically racialized, gendered, disabled, or otherwise bodily marked—with positive or negative words. Even though not all implicit bias is sparked by sight, explanations of how it happens in real life tend to emphasize visual sense: seeing a feminized name and treating a CV more critically; viewing a picture of a white person or a person of Asian descent while listening to a lecture and making different judgments on intelligibility; watching a Black person reach into their pocket and registering risk rather than nonchalance. Likewise, many solutions aimed at limiting the effects of implicit bias—whether they work or not—tend to rely on controlling vision: performing arts auditions are done “blind;” training brings implicit bias “before the eyes” of search committees; data is gathered, visualized, and published to ensure accountability.</p>

								<p>Now, even if you are persuaded that implicit bias is a reasonable subject for a book about visual rhetoric, you might still wonder why it is headlining a chapter titled “Sight Itself,” a chapter that aims to address vision as an embodied, sensory function. Here’s your answer: the features that make implicit bias so powerful and so difficult to change are also built into the bodily mechanisms and processes of sight. This fact does not mean that implicit bias is inevitable or natural. It is, however, rooted in the physiology and psychology of sensation, embodied matters that have developed over millennia alongside social and cultural practices of identification and division. That means that visual rhetoric ought to have a great deal to say about implicit bias and, likewise, that if rhetoricians don’t grapple with sight’s embodied nature, we will miss a great deal of what makes the visual rhetorical. The visual is fully embedded in physical, cognitive, social, and cultural matrices. What lookers see, how they see, and what they do with sight all create the “rhetorics” of sight and of implicit bias. And the rhetorical mechanisms of implicit bias are ideal for illuminating the rhetorical functions of sight itself. Sight is about bodies as complex, situated, and visceral. It is also about bodies as habituated and trained. Sight itself is riddled with implicit bias.</p>
								<p><b>For all that sensation is presently de rigueur in the humanities, it can be easy to forget that vision is a sense.</b></p>
								<p>Perhaps because the “pictorial turn” preceded the “affective turn” or because the legacy of Western modernity has turned vision into a matter of disembodied cognition, recent  humanistic work on sensation, embodiment, and feeling has tended to prioritize senses other than vision. Though there are important recent exceptions,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> within rhetorical studies, “visual rhetoric” and “sensory rhetorics” have largely gone in separate directions. But, as the previous paragraphs—and those recent exceptions—suggest, understanding the rhetorical function of the visual requires attending to its bodily, sensory nature.</p>
								<p>Habitually (and ironically), visual analysis and criticism tend to presume a thinking, largely disembodied viewer. But recent visual scholars remind us that viewers are feelers as much or more than thinkers. “We do not see with our eyes alone,” Janet Vertesi notes, “Learning to see requires both bodily skills and instrumental techniques" (2015, 9). Tina Campt, likewise, treats seeing as a multisensory act that extends well beyond interpretation of stimuli. Campt “challenge[s]... the equation of vision with knowledge” (2017, 6) and proposes “listening to images” as a means for gaining “access to the affective registers through which these images enunciate alternate accounts of their subjects” (5). Sight is a matter of sensory input that, in the process, implicates and incorporates full bodies—including the neural pathways of the brain.</p>

									</div>
								<p>And that is why implicit bias offers such a generative framework for grappling with sight itself, with vision as embodied sensation: it reminds us that perception not only cues judgment, it is judgment. Perception and judgment are simultaneous, interdependent bodily matters. “All that you see, all that you have seen, and everything you will ever see,” James Stone writes, “ is delivered to your brain as a stream of digital pulses whizzing along the fragile threads of salty, fluid-filled cables that are your nerve fibers" (2021, 1). Even when we treat vision as a sense that crucially involves the brain, we must also treat its fleshiness—soma, endoneurium, fiber. And what our bodies do in making, gathering, processing, and responding to those fleshy signals has enormous consequence for what we see—or don’t see—around us.</p>
								<p>So, to understand the rhetorical functions of sight itself, we begin with a brief and much-too-simple discussion of what sight actually is (and isn’t). Then, working through psychological and sociological research on racialized perception, we confront the question of whether viewers actually see what they’re looking at, and, finally, we consider what viewers <i>do</i> with their seeing. Taken together, these discussions make clear that rhetoricians need to approach sight as physical, visceral, and sensory in order to do visual rhetoric well.</p>

									<p>People who study rhetoric often delight in discovering rhetoric in unexpected places. We are no different. And so Christa was overjoyed to open books about visual perception and find them peppered with commentary that could as easily have been written by a rhetorical scholar. “Seeing,” E. T. Jaynes writes, “is not a direct apprehension of reality … Quite the contrary: seeing is inference from incomplete information” (2003, 133). When processing the reams of evidence taken in through an eye, James Stone explains, “the brain, drawing on some 3.8 billion years of inherited evolutionary experience, does what it does best: it makes an intelligent guess” (Stone 2012, 2). Sight itself, in other words, is a function of the probable, not the actual. Just like rhetoric. Take that back to your cave, Plato, and have a good, hard look.</p>

									<p>Stone tells us that even though scientists know a great deal about “optics, the eye, and the brain,” sight itself is still a mystery: “the truth is that nobody knows exactly how we see” (2012, 1). But, even with incomplete knowledge, what is known about sight is evocative for visual rhetoric and worth learning for anyone interested in studying the rhetorical functions of the visual. Our overview of what happens, physically, to produce sight is rudimentary<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, but it highlights some key elements and the points where uncertainty and probability come into the mix most prominently. </p>
									<p>We begin by noting that sight is not a universal human experience (Friedman 2016; Obasogie 2013). Not everyone perceives the world through their eyes. Not everyone who sees sees in the same way or sees the same thing. This brief tour of the science of sight then, is a composite of useful information about sight but not a full accounting of how vision works, and certainly not an account of how “we” see.</p>
									<p>Eyes appear to have evolved independently in multiple phyla starting some 543 million years ago (Stone 2012, 17, 21). Different species have eyes that are more or less elaborate, and different evolutionary needs have led to different features across species. But eyes have been around for a long time and, once they appeared, they developed quickly as means of competition and survival.</p>

									</div>
									<p>A simple eye, producing images through a single unit (one eye rather than compound eyes),“can form an image on the back of the eye or retina with or without a lens" (Stone 2012, 21). The human eye, while “simple” because contained in one unit, is a complex ball of gel with cornea, pupil, lens, and iris out front and retina, optic nerve, and macula in the back. Photoreceptors on the retina process light entering through the cornea and lens. Rods help supply low light vision and cones register color—though the nature of the lens means not all colors can be in-focus at the same time (24). Because of its physical characteristics and evolution, the eye can be “tricked” about color, shape, and focus.</p>
									<p>The eye itself is far more sensitive to light than most digital cameras—the retina has 126 million photoreceptors. The optic nerve, which carries information from the eye to the brain, however, has only 1 million fibers (Stone 2012, 30). “At first,” Stone writes, “this seems to imply that the eye is not telling the brain everything it knows” (30). “However,” he continues, “what the eye does not tell the brain, the brain does not need to know” (31). Images taken in through the eyes contain a great deal of repetition (for example, I don’t really need to process every single pixel of yellow siding on the neighbor’s house). Equally importantly, the brain has stored information about the world that it can draw on to complete pictures. Sight—in all eye-using creatures—makes the world from an approximation of what photoreceptors receive. Stone explains, “the brain does not need to know such details” (32). Eliminating redundancy allows the eye to transmit large, complicated images to the brain along the finite resource of the optic nerve (32). It also, however, means that sight is a guessing function not, as positivists would have us believe, a direct apprehension of the world.</p>

									<p>Sight—even in its most extraordinary and effective forms—doesn’t produce a direct copy of the world before the eyes. “Each time we open our eyes we are confronted with an overwhelming amount of information,” Marisa Carrasco explains (2011, 1484). “Despite this, we experience a seemingly effortless understanding of our visual world. This requires separating the wheat from the chaff, selecting relevant information out of irrelevant noise" (1484). In order to see the world, Stone similarly explains, “the brain has to interpret the retinal image, which is full of lies and omissions. The brain’s task is to see beyond these, to ignore the lies and fill in the omissions” (2012, 15) That process requires the brain to make judgments and determine probabilities based on previously acquired information. “Fortunately,” Stone continues, “the lies and omissions don’t change from day to day but are law-like and systematic, and this systematicity allows the brain to correctly interpret all but the most ambiguous retinal images” (15).</p>
									<p>Hopeful though Stone is about the brain’s ability to correctly interpret what the eyes transmit, researchers working on race and visual perception tell us that all is not right with the lies, omissions, best guesses, and probabilities that fill the space between lens and brain. And here we enter the realm where the science of sight and the science of implicit bias converge. Despite Stone’s insistence that the eye and brain mostly interpret the world “correctly” except in ambiguous cases, researchers have increasingly found that a very wide range of what is seen is, in fact, ambiguous. As Eberhardt et al explain, “Retinal images are inherently ambiguous and get resolved in ways most functional and meaningful to perceivers” (2003, 360). And, they elaborate, that “ambiguity” is cultural, political, biased, gendered, and racialized. The “law-like and systematic” omissions that human brains use to interpret signals from the eyes? They include white supremacy and its corollaries.</p>

									<p>Sensations—including vision—are learned, trained, and habituated. Though they are bodily and natural—created in nature through evolution—they are also enmeshed in context, proceed through situated practice, and inculcated via pedagogies. Jordynn Jack makes this point forcefully with regard to scientific vision, tracking the “pedagogy of sight” through which early microscope users learned to identify and interpret what they saw through the lens (2009). But pedagogies of sight aren’t merely implicated in external visual technologies. Human vision as a whole is learned, and the world that is seen is seen through an enormous amount of physical, cognitive, and social processing.</p>
									<p>Such processing begins early in life and sediments over time. “The brain develops in infancy certain assumptions about the world based on all the sensory information it receives,” Jaynes and Bretthorst write (2013, 133). “For example, nearer objects appear larger, have greater parallax, and occlude distant objects in the same line of sight; a straight line appears straight from whatever direction it is viewed, etc. … We hold tenaciously onto [these rules] because they have been successful in correlating many different experiences” (133). But we also sometimes hold onto those rules more tenaciously than we should. What is seen is not necessarily what is. Instead, it is the best approximation of what is based on a confluence of sensory input and previous experience. Frequently, the physical impressions left on the retina by the light reflecting off of objects could correlate to a wide variety of shapes, but experience tells us that some shapes are more probable than others (Stone 2012, 5). When forming the image seen, the brain selects what is most likely and presents it as what is. As Stone puts it, “experience is required to disambiguate images” (6). But experience is racialized, gendered, socialized, politicized, and filled with implicit and explicit bias.</p>

									</div>
									<p>Indeed, Stone continues, “the brain is forced to interpret an image that is fundamentally ambiguous by adding its own bias” (7-8). This recognition has spawned an almost alarming number of articles about visual perception that begin with the phrase “Believing is Seeing.”<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> In an interview, Anthony Greenwald—psychologist and expert on implicit bias—explains just this point with regard to racial profiling. </p>
									<blockquote align="left">“When a black person does something that is open to alternative interpretations, like reaching into a pocket or a car’s glove compartment, many people—not just police officers—may think first that it’s possibly dangerous. But that wouldn’t happen in viewing a white person do exactly the same action” (Greenwald quoted in Mason 2020).</blockquote>
									<p>Everyday movements—simple and straightforward, like reaching into a pocket—are socio-culturally and physio-cognitively ambiguous because of white supremacy. Seeing those movements requires body and brain to draw on previous experience and activate biases. And so viewers—especially white viewers in the United States—see in the very same action a Black man reaching for a weapon and a white man pulling out his wallet. Likewise, in their research on visual associations between criminality and Blackness, Eberhard, Goff, Purdie, and Davies (2004) found that study participants were statistically quicker to recognize a weapon when primed with a Black face than with a white one and that biased connections between Blackness and criminality were bi-directional: when white study participants viewed images associated with criminality, they tended to notice Blackness and when primed with Black faces, they were more attentive to images of objects associated with crime:</p> <blockquote align="left">“Bidirectional associations operate as visual tuning devices by determining the perceptual relevance of stimuli in the physical environment. That is, given the processing capacity limitations that all perceivers face, these associations determine which information is important and worthy of attention and which is not. So, for example, the association of Blacks with crime renders crime objects relevant in the context of Black faces and Black faces relevant in the context of crime” (Eberhardt et al 2004, 877).</blockquote> 
									<p>“Experience is required to disambiguate images,” Stone tells us, but the experience used to make vision work is as biased as sight itself (2012, 6).</p>

									<p>If sight is never about perceiving exactly what is before the eyes but, rather, a matter of physical presumption, reduction, and interpretation, then the rhetorical function of the visual extends all the way back to the cornea and lens. Implicit bias is not evidence of vision’s failure; instead, it is an indication of its endemic rhetoricity. Long-standing presumptions that viewers would see what was real if they simply looked hard enough or in the right ways or with enough anti-bias training are all eviscerated by the physiology, psychology, and sociology of sight itself. “Social imagination is not only affected by physical difference but it is active in creating and maintaining the perception of those differences,” Eberhardt et. al. explain (2003, 369). This recognition does not excuse or justify bias—implicit or otherwise. Instead, it asks scholars interested in visual rhetoric to treat all vision as infused with bias, all sight as always already rhetorical, and all rhetorical vision as situated, biased, embodied, and racialized. </p>
									<p>The obligation for rhetoricians once we recognize sight itself as a rhetorical function of the visual is to attend to the patterns that predetermine what is seen. Stone writes, <i>“Your knowledge alters how you see things. The things you see become part of your knowledge. Your knowledge alters how you see things. You can never see the things themselves.”</i> (2012, 155, italics original). Jaynes adds, “We will not relinquish successful hypotheses as long as they work; the only way to make one change these assumptions is to put one in a situation where they don’t work” (2003, 133). The biases built into sight itself are important (and important to rhetoricians) “not only because they can lead perceivers to make mistakes occasionally but also because they can guide, generally, how perceivers come to organize and structure the visual stimuli to which they are exposed” (Eberhardt et al 2004, 878). Along the way, “stereotypic associations” driven by visual perception “help people to respond to their environment by rendering certain social groups and objects especially relevant and thus worthy of attention” (890). Sight itself, embodied, racialized, biased, is constitutive rhetoric.</p>

									</div>
									<p>So, what ought rhetoricians do with this information? How ought the recognition that sight itself is a rhetorical function change analytical practice?</p>
									<p>First, it seems even more essential than ever to eschew presumptions about how or what “we” see. Such presumptions are not only ableist, they also miss the message that socio-cultural contexts matter immensely. The implicit biases of one place and time do not map neatly onto those of another time. Neither does sight. In the United States, white viewers see differently than Black viewers do when looking at race. Results in implicit bias tests, for example, are markedly less biased for Black and Latinx test-takers than white and Asian-American test takers.</p>
									<p>The recent history of the Müller-Lyer illusion adds additional nuance to that recognition of differential sight. For nearly a century, researchers studying vision and perception thought that reaction to the image below was universal. Because of how human visual perception worked, they thought, every viewer would perceive line B, below, as longer than line A.</p>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/ch-5/5-muller.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>And then, nearly one hundred years after Müller-Lyer developed the illusion, researchers thought to show the lines to viewers not immersed in Western worlds and worldviews. Suddenly, they had to acknowledge that what had been presumed to be a universal feature of sight was, in fact, cultural and contingent. Viewers in Western and Westernized cultures learned to see the world in ways that prepared them to make a visual mistake. Viewers in other contexts hadn’t necessarily learned those biases. They sometimes saw the two lines as equivalent, foiling the illusion.</p>
									<p>In the same way, rhetoricians looking at pictures, describing them, and analyzing them ought to have less confidence about what those pictures show and what viewers will see. They ought to withhold confidence not just because other viewers might see different things (this outcome is actually less likely) but because those other viewers might all see the same thing. That sameness is telling. It is as much an approximation and indication of rhetoric at work as any differences would be. Whether they see the same thing or different things, viewer and analyst both take the part for the whole. They make meaning from partial information and base judgements on probability. And even when that invention doesn’t introduce error or bias, it still grants what is seen a reality and certainty that it doesn’t merit.</p>
									<p>Just as Safiya Umoja Noble (2018) and others have noted the biases built into how algorithms “see” data and perpetuate selection biases based on programming, visual rhetoricians ought to approach sight itself as “disaggregating fleshy bodies into … discrete packets of codified information” upon which yet other brains and bodies build judgment (Elwood and Leszczynski, 2018, 632). The tools of visual rhetoric thus extend in new ways not only into study of implicit bias and code but also into medical and scientific imaging, visual pedagogy, and political imagination. It can, likewise, complicate presumptions about the nature and effects of “bringing before the eyes” any particular social issue or problem.</p>
									<p>Finally, rhetoricians interested in the visual can and should track histories of sight and of vision. Greenwald explains, “The mechanisms by which our brains form associations and acquire them from the cultural environment evolved over long periods of time, during which people lived in an environment that was consistent. They were not actually likely to acquire something that they would later have to unlearn, because the environment wasn’t going to change. So there may have been no evolutionary pressure for the human brain to develop a method of unlearning the associations.”  If this is the case, then rhetoricians need to know more about the contexts in which habits of sight emerged and need to recognize the patterns that have developed over time. And then, we need to pursue the habits of perception and judgment that can help disrupt such patterns and provide the impetus necessary to force a change in well-established ways of seeing. Both Greenwald, writing about implicit bias, and Jaynes and Bretthorst, writing about perception, note that visual bias will only change when a way of seeing becomes completely untenable for the viewer. Visual rhetoricians, then, have an obligation to research, identify, and pursue the conditions under which racist, sexist, xenophobic, ableist, and other biased visual habits can be made invalid.</p>
									<p>Addressing sight itself as a rhetorical function of the visual will require visual rhetoricians to pursue new training and engage new subjects in new ways. From our viewpoint, that disconcerting, discomfiting work will be well worth it.</p>
