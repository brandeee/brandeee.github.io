									<h2>Introduction</h2>
									<p>We open this visual rhetoric project with a crowded photograph of a fairly ordinary urban street.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/intro/i-header.jpg" alt="A photograph of a sidewalk at night after rain, with a person walking away from the camera in the center of the image" /></div>
			<!--INTRO-->
								<p>You might encounter a scene like this one most days: cars, street signs, sidewalk, plantings, a riot of text and signage. Perhaps your everyday visual environment is more residential or more rural, less car-focused or more driven by freeways, filled with obvious signals of human habitation or only subtly shaped by human hands. Perhaps you orient yourself in the world through other senses, constantly navigating spaces that presume vision, but without it.</p>
								<p><b>So, where is visual rhetoric in this picture? The photograph itself is serving a pedagogical function for us, of course. We’re using it to start a conversation about visual rhetoric.</b></p>
								<p>There are a number of symbols in the picture that likely have meaning for most viewers. That shared visual meaning, in turn,  shapes viewers’ behaviors. The red and white sign on a post at the center left, tiny as it is, will keep anyone who drives regularly from parking there (as will the red hydrant a few yards farther down the sidewalk). If you were walking along the street in the picture, stoplights and brakelights might give you pause—literally. </p> 
								<p>The picture also captures aspects of the built environment that act rhetorically. The bike racks that appear every hundred feet or so instantiate a particular approach to urban planning, as do the carefully fenced plantings along the left. The wide sidewalk, marquees, and closely packed buildings cue up an urban aesthetic that locates the photograph even for viewers who couldn’t identify the exact city or neighborhood it shows. Clothing and hairstyles, maybe even the blue glove on the pedestrian’s right hand, help locate the photograph temporally.</p>

								<p>This photograph, then, is rich in what rhetoricians have often called “visual rhetoric.” It also encapsulates what has often made visual rhetoric hard to define. Invoking visual rhetoric, rhetoricians have variously analyzed visual objects (pictorial instantiations of a “thing” called rhetoric); referenced methodology (an approach to rhetoric informed by the ubiquity of visual stimuli); engaged in theorizing (reconceptualizing  rhetoric through vision); or identified themselves with  a sub-field of rhetorical studies (a conglomerate of scholars with shared interest in things visual).</p>
								<p><b>Throughout this project, we approach visual rhetoric as encompassing all those elements. We also argue for a major shift in how rhetoricians think, write, and teach about vision and rhetoric.</b></p>
								<p>As we will demonstrate throughout this project, visual rhetoric includes and is far more than the orientations named above. Visual rhetoric has encompassed all of them, and it should, not least because scholars have shown how “the visual” itself is so varied. The intersection of rhetoric and the visual draws our attention to objects like the signs and structures in our opening picture (and also photographs, artwork, multimodal texts, etc.);<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> it includes images like the vision of ideal urban spaces informing development in the picture (and other intangible ideas, descriptions, and figures);<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> it includes visual technologies like the camera used to take the photograph (and also lenses, pigments and pixels, fiber optics, etc);<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> it includes the physical-cognitive act of seeing through which we processed the scene and photograph (and that involves retinas, optic nerves, brains, and more);<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> and it includes the social, cultural, and political worlds in which seeing practices emerge and function—including the ones that led us to mark this photograph as aesthetically unremarkable.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> Indeed, visual rhetoric is a vibrant area of research because it offers such robust depth of field.</p>
								<p>However, thanks to that complexity, visual rhetoricians have lacked a shared theory of the visual. Visual rhetoric—as a scholarly field—has been established piecemeal, constituted by the case study as scholars illuminate particular objects and concepts. While the study of pictures’ persuasive power is ancient and visual rhetoric has been a popular term since the 1990s, most studies identifying themselves as doing visual rhetoric examine specific pictures or modes. Ultimately, scholarship in visual rhetoric is rich in concepts but lacking in synthesis.</p>
								<p>Without a synthetic account of the rhetorical functions of the visual, scholars in visual rhetoric frequently revert to arguments about the value of visual rhetoric rather than pressing forward to re-theorize the nature of rhetoric. In this book, we argue that visual rhetoric needs an overarching frame not only to show us what we have (and have done) but also to show what we have left out.</p>
								<p>We find that, despite all the variety of the visual, visual rhetoric scholars have mostly done our work within frames provided by the conditions of Western democracy, by discourses of citizenship, and by presumptions of normative public engagement. These frames have offered a fairly narrow, and exclusionary, path—one pre-cut by the proclivities of our larger discipline, which is theoretically and structurally built from and centered on whiteness, Westernness, and coloniality.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> We begin this project by identifying these traditional frames and their affordances, but also their shortcomings. In doing so, we reveal the vast stretches of rhetorical functions that exceed, undergird, and surround them.</p>
								<p><b>Whatever our visual environments and our relations to them, we are surrounded by and immersed in what we call “the rhetorical functions of the visual,” a term that—we argue—is more capacious, specific, and useful than the more popular “visual rhetoric.”</b></p>
								<p>In order to theorize these rhetorical functions of the visual, we identify six key functions that include but exceed what scholars have called visual rhetoric.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> This conceptual shift to “rhetorical functions of the visual” helps us challenge the subfield’s over association of visuality with objects (iconic photographs, awe-inspiring landscapes, compelling propaganda) to more broadly understand the immensely varied means by which vision encounters rhetoric and rhetoric infuses vision. The rhetorical functions of the visual—multiple, complex, and varied—are ubiquitous in our everyday lives just as they are in our opening photograph. The visual acts on us in ways both explicit and implicit.</p>
								<p>Our theory of the rhetorical functions of the visual is organized in two parts. Part I’s three chapters take up each of the familiar, more traditional frames in turn, showing how each reveals a crucial rhetorical function of the visual, yet cannot fully account for visuality. Part I highlights the pedagogical, catalytic, and communal building functions of the visual. The chapters of Part II introduce another three rhetorical functions of the visual that are equally crucial yet less frequently examined by rhetoricians: oversight, sight itself, and noticing. Together, these six chapters offer a comprehensive—though not exhaustive—account of the nature and force of visual rhetoric with particular focus on visuality’s hegemonic functions.</p>

									<p>Visual rhetoric’s typical frames have allowed us to understand essential aspects of how pictures and vision create effects in the world. They have illuminated three common and powerful rhetorical functions of the visual. The first three chapters of “On Visual Rhetoric” identify those functions, show them at work within existing scholarship, identify key theories, and establish the functions’ import and limits. These rhetorical functions of the visual are related to public argument and they typically focus on visual objects. They are also rooted in the three traditional “branches” of rhetoric. That pedagogical capacity is deliberative; the catalytic force of the visual is forensic; and communal effects invoke the epideictic. Studying these functions has allowed scholars to understand essential aspects of how pictures and vision create effects in the world. However, they are not sufficient. </p>

									<h2><a href="chapter-1.html">Chapter 1: Pictured Deliberation</a></h2>
									<p>Pictures and images participate in communication about what ought to be done and how a community ought to proceed in facing challenges. Looking at this rhetorical function through the colored light of medieval stained glass, we examine its ability to highlight the visual’s public and pedagogical aspects yet note its shortcomings for grappling with violence, coercion, and power differentials.</p>

									<h2><a href="chapter-2.html">Chapter 2: Catalytic Vision</a></h2>
									<p>Rhetoricians have been especially drawn to pictures’ capacity to indict and catalyze action. Taking Eddie Adams’ iconic “Saigon Execution” as its central object, this chapter highlights the convicting power of the visual and recognizes how that power easily moves analysts toward iconoclasm.</p>

									<h2><a href="chapter-3.html">Chapter 3: Making Common Sight</a></h2>
									<p>Vision serves communal functions, inviting viewers to picture ourselves and our relations with others. This chapter plumbs that epideictic function of the visual using a set of images that literally (but abstractly) picture the public: political maps and their depictions of good and ill in the national body.</p>

									<p>Having established that the first three functions draw from an Aristotelian frame, and therefore function within a hegemonic framework, Part II introduces three additional functions. These three rhetorical functions of the visual—oversight, sight itself, and noticing—begin from the presumption of inequitable power relations and unequal access to vision. They also locate vision and the visual beyond visual objects—highlighting visual processes, technologies, and habits as sites of the rhetorical functions of the visual. They emphasize the material functions and limitations of rhetorical practice otherwise. Though we recognize that there are additional rhetorical functions of the visual that work outside of and against hegemonic frames—and that the three we name contain possibility for rupture and resistance—, we focus here on an account of how visual rhetoric functions hegemonically. We believe that they deserve as much—or more—attention than the three more familiar functions have received.</p><br>

									<h2><a href="chapter-4.html">Chapter 4: Oversight</a></h2>
									<p>Surveillance is not always about pictures but it is always about oversight or what Nicolas Mirzoeff terms “visuality.” That practice of visuality is ubiquitous, profoundly racialized, and crucial for understanding the rhetorical functions of the visual. This chapter investigates the visual as a means of control and a site of refusal. Visual technologies of racialization take central stage in this chapter, focused through the lens of Polaroid’s ID-2 camera, its role in apartheid South Africa, and a boycott led by the Polaroid Revolutionary Workers Movement.</p>

									<h2><a href="chapter-5.html">Chapter 5: Sight Itself</a></h2>
									<p>Visual rhetoric has typically looked at things seen, not the act of seeing. But rhetoricians must follow neural pulses through bodies if we hope to understand the force of the visual. When we omit sight’s embodied nature, we miss a great deal of what makes vision rhetorical. What lookers see, how they see, and what they do with sight all create the “rhetorics” of sight. Sight is about bodies as complex, situated, racialized, and visceral. It is also about bodies as habituated and trained. The chapter weaves together psychological work on implicit bias and physiological study of human visual processes to treat the fleshy matters of vision as profoundly, thoroughly, and generatively rhetorical.</p>

									<h2><a href="chapter-6.html">Chapter 6: Noticing</a></h2>
									<p>Noticing (and not noticing) happen subtly yet they have significant effects. Naming “noticing” as a rhetorical function helps us identify visual rhetorics of acquiescence and normalcy that are ubiquitous but hard to track. Once again engaging scholarship on the psychology of sight, this chapter highlights the complexity of attention as a visual function in order to complicate rhetorical studies’ long-standing emphasis on importance and magnitude. Using the rhetorical problem of picturing climate change as our foil, we demonstrate what visual rhetoricians gain by attending to that which audiences fail to notice.</p>

       									 <p>As we note throughout this introduction and Part I, study of visual objects has been, to date, the bread and butter of visual rhetoric scholarship.
