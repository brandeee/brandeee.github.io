									<h1>Part I</h1>
									<p>The chapters of Part I work through the affordances, key terms, and limitations of three rhetorical functions of the visual most closely associated with traditional understandings of rhetoric and, consequently, most frequently elaborated in visual rhetoric scholarship to date.</p>

								<p>Since at least the mid twentieth century, rhetorical scholars have thought of “rhetoric” as not only written or spoken persuasion but as encompassing all forms of communication seeking to change attitudes, beliefs, and actions. Bodies, sound, space, and pictures have become essential foci for rhetorical study, and rich bodies of scholarship have grown up around them. A portion of that scholarship has shown that attention to pictures, spaces, sounds, and bodies is nothing new for the study of rhetoric in Western traditions but appears in earlier rhetorical practice as well (for example, in detailed drawings from Gilbert Austin’s <i>Chironomia,</i> above). Another branch of that scholarship has, likewise, pointed out the parochialism of the West in this regard, noting that the vast realm of rhetorical practice beyond the West generally never lost sight of rhetoric’s capacious means.</p>
								<p>As rhetorical scholars steeped in Western frameworks began to expand their horizons beyond text and language, the visual was one of the first modes that garnered attention. Starting in the 60s and 70s and then gaining traction in the 1990s there has been a steady stream of rhetorical scholars publishing about the visual ever since.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Most consistently, studies of visual rhetoric have treated pictures—visual objects—as they circulate in public.</p>
								<p>The persuasive force of pictures has been explored through case studies covering an array of media, moments, and locations. Photography—especially journalistic and documentary photography—has been particularly salient for visual rhetoric scholarship, but murals, postcards, monuments, paintings, and films have also found their place.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Occasionally, especially in the first decades of the 21st century, rhetorical scholars have also written about the visual without centering visual objects, giving attention to phantasia and ekphrasis<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> or treating what Nicolas Mirzoeff calls “visuality” in terms of surveillance and other viewing practices (2011).<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
								<p>Unsurprisingly, given the larger biases of rhetorical studies, focus on public circulation and public uptake has been a consistent feature of rhetorical scholarship addressing the visual. In this vein, analyses have focused largely on contexts that are at least quasi-democratic, where viewers are equipped to act politically with and in response to the pictures under discussion. Though the vast majority of this scholarship highlights resistance to dominant political worlds or illuminates fault lines in them, in rather Habermasian form, visual rhetoricians have tended to start from an ideal of public, democratic access, treating it as a norm—even if always as yet unreached.</p>
								<p>For a long time, rhetorical scholars writing about the visual faced skepticism and dismissal on the grounds that visual objects simply didn’t belong. In various essays from the early 2000s, Cara Finnegan urged scholars of visual rhetoric to move beyond such arguments asserting that pictures should count as rhetoric, urging instead more complex theorizations of vision, visuality, and rhetoric (2004; 2005; Finnegan and Kang 2004). But around the same time, David Fleming asserted that pictures—though persuasive and meaning-filled—could not be arguments, and Kristy Fleckenstein firmly distinguished the persuasive work of pictures from “rhetoric,” arguing that rhetoric was by definition about words and therefore could not adequately address the visual complexity of our contemporary world (Fleming 1996, Fleckenstein 2003).</p>
								<p>The relatively traditional orientations taken by rhetoricians working on the visual, therefore, ought to be seen as artifacts of those disciplinary arguments. Making the case for pictures meant showing how they fit within existing frameworks for rhetorical study—they can make arguments, they are forms of public address, they can be analyzed as discrete objects and genres. Along the way, as those disciplinary arguments shaped the study of what became known as “visual rhetoric,” what visual rhetoric was and what it did—rhetorically—likewise conformed to familiar and traditional rhetorical functions. In other words, we suggest, in addition to taking on contexts and methods that were—for the most part—easily recognized by more traditional rhetorical scholars, visual rhetoric scholars largely held to a latent Aristotelian framework for the rhetorical functions of the visual. Visual rhetoric, like ancient Greek or Roman rhetoric, then, served primarily deliberative, forensic, and epideictic purposes. These underlying frameworks, we argue, have had a profound effect on rhetorical study of the visual—enabling and constraining its scope.</p>

									<p>These three rhetorical functions of the visual, we note, are rooted in the three traditional “branches” of rhetoric elaborated by Aristotle in the fourth century B.C.E. Given how thoroughly the tenets of Greek rhetorical theory have infused later work in rhetorical studies, it is not unexpected that the traditional branches associated with the forum, the public stage, and the court have been central to the rhetorical study of the visual. Studying these three rhetorical functions of the visual has allowed students and scholars to understand essential aspects of how pictures and vision create effects in the world. We highlight those insights in the chapters of Part I.</p>
									<p>However, prioritizing three rhetorical functions of the visual that have their roots in a particular place and tradition, is ultimately limiting. While visual rhetoricians have done good work using those three functions to illuminate how power works inequitably and how marginalized rhetors challenge, reimagine, and dismantle oppressive structures, a comprehensive account of the rhetorical functions of the visual still requires moving beyond the familiar territories. The Aristotelian branches of rhetoric are still useful frames for analyzing the practice of public rhetoric in a [nominally] republican context, but they do not exhaust the possible means by which the rhetorical moves in the world. In addition, each of these frameworks creates omissions and lacunae--possibilities that visual rhetoricians are less likely to consider because of those frameworks’ underlying assumptions. The three chapters of Part I therefore also draw attention to the limitations and absences baked into these three traditional rhetorical functions of the visual.</p>
									<p>Part I, in other words, begins from the foundations of visual rhetoric scholarship, theorizing three rhetorical functions of the visual that will feel familiar—even if previously unnamed—to rhetorical scholars; it also, simultaneously, unsettles those foundations, revealing the need for more capacious, less parochial frameworks.</p>
