									<h1>Part II</h1>
									<p>Since we have spent three chapters suggesting that visual rhetoric scholarship to date has erred on the Aristotelian side, that begs the question: what else is there?</p> 
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/intro/pt2-tower.jpg" alt="A black and white photograph of a radio tower, looking up from below" /></div>
								<p>The chapters of Part II offer a partial answer, adding three additional rhetorical functions of the visual that round out at least the hegemonic means through which the visual gains force and influence. These chapters elaborate rhetorical functions of the visual that exceed the object-focused, public-address-oriented, democratically inclined frameworks of the Aristotelian trio. The three rhetorical functions outlined here—oversight, sight itself, and noticing—depart from the traditional functions in a number of ways.</p>
								<p>First, the rhetorical functions of Part II begin from a presumption of inequitable power relations and are not premised on traditional rhetorical contexts. Adhering to theoretical orientations already resonant in the larger field of rhetorical studies, these functions move away from the forums of public address—both public and counterpublic—finding the rhetorical in relations among humans and with non-human others, in ambience and the habitual, in ecologies, flows, and stoppages. The notion of rhetoric underlying these rhetorical functions, in other words, is simultaneously more nefarious and more partial, more diffuse and more dangerous. These rhetorical functions of the visual are at work all the time, even when no one is speaking and there are no particular pictures to be found.</p>
								<p>Second, as that last sentence suggests, the rhetorical functions outlined in Part II only occasionally inhere in individual visual objects. Instead, they emerge via habituated visual processes, ubiquitous technologies, and everyday visual encounters. They draw attention to the relationships between vision and control and to the sighted patterns infusing cultural and social practice. Our elaboration of these functions draws from research in psychology and physiology to understand deep-seated visual functions and the embodied yet socialized processes that perpetuate and make meaning from them.</p>
								<p>Finally, each of these Part II rhetorical functions of the visual begins from the assumption of unequal access to vision. Not everyone sees by ocular means, most viewing is technologically mediated, and even under controlled conditions, viewers don’t necessarily all see the same thing. By moving away from functions tethered to individual viewers, looking earlier in the process of visual meaning-making for those individual viewers, and treating habitual rather than intentional sight, the rhetorical functions of oversight, sight itself, and noticing retheorize what it means to see and be seen, rhetorically.</p>
